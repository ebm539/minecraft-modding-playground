# A playground for me to play around with modding Minecraft

## Current ideas:

### Modding existing content:

- Creepers are modded so that on explosion they actually spawn a cat instead of causing any damage
- Minecarts are modded to have a boost key
- Add hungry chests that have a random chance of 'eating' an item on inventory access (e.g. by a player or by a hopper)
- Falling below bedrock teleports you to the top of the world
- Minecarts no longer require rails - instead the minecart places rails

### Modding by adding new content:

- New ores and tools
- New mobs
- New blocks e.g. an auto tree remover that removes a tree log by log (descending)
- Compasses placed in game world gen
- New food e.g. cheeseburgers (where if you eat too many or try to eat when full, you gain slowness/tiredness)
