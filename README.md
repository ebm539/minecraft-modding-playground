# A playground for me to play around with modding Minecraft

## Current ideas:

### Modding existing content:

- Creepers are modded so that on explosion they actually spawn a cat instead of causing any damage
- Minecarts are modded to have a boost key
- Add hungry chests that have a random chance of 'eating' an item on inventory access (e.g. by a player or by a hopper)
- Falling below bedrock teleports you to the top of the world
- Minecarts no longer require rails - instead the minecart places rails

### Modding by adding new content:

- New ores and tools
- New mobs
- New blocks e.g. an auto tree remover that removes a tree log by log (descending)
- Compasses placed in game world gen
- New food e.g. cheeseburgers (where if you eat too many or try to eat when full, you gain slowness/tiredness)


### Entirely unrelated

- Inspired by [/r/baduibattles](https://old.reddit.com/r/baduibattles): entering text in Minecraft, by placing blocks and then interpreting the blocks/lack thereof with an OCR system.
- Using the Minecraft day count and time as an input for a date/time picker in another program


### This isn't Minecraft

- Beat Saber, but for text input: type a word/sentence by selecting the characters flying towards you in Beat Saber squares
- In VR: inputting text by grabbing blocks (think a Minecraft-like 3D voxel environment)
- Factorio as text input: enter text by assembling the letters, requiring their own production lines
- Golf: enter numbers by score for the end of each hole (birdies and below remove the number of digits, par and above enters the digits' value)
- Bowling: enter numbers by score for the end of each turn, a split removes the number with the score value
  - For golf and bowling, I'm envisioning some extremely wacky integration with Wii Sports
